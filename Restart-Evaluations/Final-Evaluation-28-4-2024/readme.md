Core Features
Create an application that fetches the employees data , filters the data by department and gender along with pagination and sorting based on salary.

fetching the employee data and populating(showing) the data on DOM in Table Format , with different rows for each employees. Have these columns

  - S.no

Creating filterBy Department feature by using DropDown (select) and filter data based on that . This is how the option should look like :

  --Select gender-- (default option)
      - male
      - female
  ```

      - high to low (desc)
  ```
fetch the data based on limit & page and implement pagination , wherein , whenever user click on next page they should move to next page with next 10 set of data , same for previous , do create disable feature (on first page prev button should be disabled , and on last page next button should be disabled) , also pagination should be working with filter and sort too.
